# Task Scheduling on Cloudsim

In this repository we have implemented task scheduling algorithms to assign cloudlets to VMs. To implement this we didn't make any changes to the **DatacenterBroker.java** class. I implemented this in the default method for printing the cloudlets.

## Simulator Used
* [Cloudsim](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim)
```
version: 3.0.3
```

## How to Use
Download the code and add it in the example package and run as usual.
